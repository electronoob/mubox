mubox
=====

µß°× or mubox is an Arduino project for providing a vt100 serial
interface to my future microcontroller projects where a GUI is
handy but I don't really care too much about other people using
it, for example I'm going to use this for a Dual-DDS module
project for RF experimentation. It will be nice to be able to
connect to the microcontroller and have access to a familiar
interface to make changes, view status of stuff or initiate
scripts. For the DDS project I will want to sweep through many
frequencies to allow me to see response with inductors and
what-have-you.

Currently there's is rudimentary [read hardcoded] authentication.

I'm at the point now of almost being ready to start on the REPL.

I'm also considering knocking together a little scripting
language for the sake of convenience.

Sorry about the code it's messy, in due course I will refactor.
